# Third-Party Art / Asset Licensing (Read This First)

This repository includes third-party art assets credited below. Each entry is copied/preserved from the original source page so the original author notes and all offered license options remain visible.

**Important: when an asset is “multi-licensed,” that means the author is offering a choice of licenses (a menu), not that all licenses apply at once.** For this repository, the license we are using for each asset is determined as follows:

1) **If CC-BY 4.0 is listed, we use the asset under CC-BY 4.0.**
2) Else, **if CC-BY 3.0 is listed, we use the asset under CC-BY 3.0.**
3) Else, **if OGA-BY 3.0 is listed, we use the asset under OGA-BY 3.0.**
4) Else, if only **CC-BY-SA** and/or **GPL** are listed, we use the asset under the listed ShareAlike license (or GPL where explicitly stated in the entry).

We comply with the chosen license for each asset, including:
- attribution (author/artist), and a link back to the source page when reasonable
- a link to the license text
- noting changes when we have modified an asset

**Code vs. art:** The license for this repository’s *code* is stated in the repo’s LICENSE file and does not override the licenses of third-party assets listed here.

Title: [LPC] Imp 2

https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-imp-2

I forgot the death animation for the original imp I posted so I've included the full red imp set along with the newly recolored green and blue imps. I arranged all the frames in the same order as the other LPC assets (top, left, bottom, right) for all the sprite sheets and I've tried to normalize all the outlines so everything has consistent color claws, weapons, and shields.

Included are 3 full sets of imp animations (walking, attacking, and dying for red, green, and blue). I don't know why I didn't think to do this earlier but better late than never!

Please leave a comment if you have one.

Title: [LPC] Monster Death Animations

I added death animations to the original LPC monsters.

The animations are procedurally generated using a script available on GitHub.

If you want to know more about the technique used, you can read this article on my blog.

Title: LPC Beetle

https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-beetle

Just a little beetle for the LPC.  It's all ready for formatting, but I honestly didn't want to finish it.  So yeah!  Enjoy.  There might be more monsters coming.  Note that it has walking animations plus attacking (two rightmost frames on each row).

 

edit: added a hole from which they might spawn per request.

Title: Pumpkin Monster

https://opengameart.org/content/pumpkin-monster

Author: Reemax

I saw the Spooky contest( https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/spooky-due-october-29 ) and I decided to participate.

Monster is taken from my very old platformer. Original monster was size of 16x16 pixel in VGA graphics. Now it is redone in size 32x64 LPC style to fit RPGs. It has all four directons, standing and two walking animations.

Title: LPC Frogman

https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-frogman

Author: Evert

Based on the frog man from Redshrike's tower defence prototype (https://opengameart.org/content/tower-defense-prototyping-assets-4-monst...).

The sideways attack and hopping frames are Redshrike's unmodified originals, the north and south frames and death animation are my own adaptations based on his work.
I plan to add a version without the trident and with an attack where he opens his mouth and attacks with his tongue, but that's a little more work.

Should work ok with LPC assets, although the palette does not match the LPC assets. I tried recolouring it, but none of the green ramps in the LPC palette work with this guy. Suggestions for that are welcome.

CHANGES:
* Added a variation with a crown by Stephen Challener (Redshrike)
* Used Puffolotti's alternate animation for the legs.

Title: LPC Monsters

Attack animations for monsters from the Liberated Pixel Cup base assets by Charles Sanchez (CharlesGabriel). Kindly commissioned by Pierre Vigier (pvigier) for Vagabond. 

Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com

If you appreciate my work, please consider supporting me and me art on my Ko-fi page! https://ko-fi.com/bluecarrot16 . I am also open for commissions; send me a direct message to discuss!

Different monsters use a variety of attacks---lunging, biting, shooting up from the ground, spitting fire, firing a laser projectile, etc. In general, attack animations should smoothly transition from/to the original idle animations.  

Bat sprite used and animated is by bagzie instead, because I liked it better than the one from the base assets. .

My contributions are licensed OGA-BY 3.0 (i.e., I waive the requirement that you must share modifications of my work under the same license, and I also specifically waive clauses in the CC-BY-* license that prohibit use of the work in a piece of software which contains DRM). However, since the original work is CC-BY-SA 3.0, and this pack is derived from those original sprites, this submission is licensed CC-BY-SA 3.0 as well. The entire bat sprite is OGA-BY 3.0.
