# Licensing / Attribution Index (assets)

This folder contains the license texts and attribution/credit sources for third-party art used in this project.

## License texts included here
- `LICENSE GPL` (GPLv3 text)
- `LICENSE-CC-BY-SA-3.0` (CC BY-SA 3.0 legalcode)

## LPC base assets (sprites + tiles)
These files were copied from the OpenGameArt “LiberatedPixelCup” repository and are provided here unchanged:
- `spriteAuthors.md`
- `tilesetAuthors.md`
- `CREDITSLPCBaseAssets.txt`

Note: The LiberatedPixelCup asset repo states its assets are dual-licensed under **CC BY-SA 3.0** and **GPLv3**. See the included license texts above.

## Weapons (per-file credits)
Weapon images sourced via the Universal LPC Spritesheet Character Generator use the upstream per-file credit mapping:
- `CREDITSFromLPCSpritesheetGenerator.csv`

That CSV contains rows mapping `weapon/...png` → author(s) → license(s) → source URL(s).

## Monsters / misc OpenGameArt assets (manual bundle)
- `MonsterCreditsLicensing.txt`
This file contains the per-asset credit blocks (title/author/source/licenses/attribution instructions) exactly as provided on the source pages.

## “liberated_pixel_cup icon”
- `liberated_pixel_cup icon`
This image was included with the LPC repo assets. It is not required for your game to function; it’s kept only as part of the upstream LPC package/branding.
If you keep/distribute it, treat it as an LPC asset (same dual-license noted above).
